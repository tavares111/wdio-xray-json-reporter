WDIO Xray JSON Reporter
===================

> A WebdriverIO plugin. Report results in Xray json format.

This project was derived from the 'wdio-json-reporter' found [here](https://github.com/fijijavis/wdio-json-reporter)


## Installation

The easiest way is to keep `wdio-xray-json-reporter` as a dependency in your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "wdio-xray-json-reporter": "~0.0.1"
  }
}
```

You can simply do it by:

```bash
npm install wdio-xray-json-reporter --save
```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html).

## Configuration

Following code shows the default wdio test runner configuration. Just add `'xray-json'` as reporter
to the array. To get some output during the test you can run the [WDIO Dot Reporter](https://github.com/webdriverio/wdio-dot-reporter) and the WDIO JSON Reporter at the same time:

```js
// wdio.conf.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: ['dot', 'xray-json'],
  reporterOptions: {
    outputDir: './'
  },
  // ...
};
```

It's also possible to combine all the resulting jsons into one.

```js
// wdio.conf.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: ['dot', 'xray-json'],
  reporterOptions: {
    outputDir: './',
    combined: true
  },
  // ...
};
```

Another option is to configure the resulting filename of the JSON, if combined is set to false or not set a number is added after the file name: wdio-results-0-1.json etc.


```js
// wdio.conf.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: ['dot', 'xray-json'],
  reporterOptions: {
    outputDir: './',
    filename: 'wdio-results'
  },
  // ...
};
```

Xray and Jira specific information:
The feature file names must match the following format to ensure the test ids match in the output match the ids in Jira.

```
ABC-123.feature -> Maps to Jira test issue ABC-123
```

Xray and Jira specific options:

```js
reporterOptions: {
    version: '1.0', // Project version in Jira
    revision: '123',
    user: 'bob', // Jira username
    project: 'bobs project', // Jira project
    testPlanKey: 'ABC-XXX' // Jira test plan id
}
```
